<h2>🔐 Web Application Security Testing – Internship Project</h2>

🔹This repository showcases my hands-on cybersecurity internship project where I performed a vulnerability assessment on an open-source, intentionally vulnerable web application. The objective was to identify security flaws using ethical hacking tools and align findings with OWASP standards.

🔹This project reflects real-world client scenarios often faced by startups, SaaS platforms, and e-commerce applications that require strong security testing.

<h2>🚀 Project Overview</h2>

🔹Set up and explored test applications like OWASP Juice Shop and DVWA

🔹Performed vulnerability scanning using tools such as:

🔹Burp Suite

🔹OWASP ZAP

🔹Nikto

<h2>✔Tested for common vulnerabilities:</h2>

🔹SQL Injection (SQLi)

🔹Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

🔹Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

🔹Mapped all findings to the OWASP Top 10

🔹Documented the vulnerabilities with:Screenshots

🔹Impact assessment

🔹Recommended remediation steps

🔹Compiled a full Security Assessment Report (PDF)

<h2>🧠 Skills Learned</h2>

🔹Web application vulnerability scanning

🔹Basics of ethical hacking & penetration testing

🔹Understanding the OWASP Top 10 risks

🔹Threat modeling & risk analysis

🔹Security documentation and reporting

<h2>🛠️ Tools & Technologies</h2>

🔹OWASP Juice Shop

🔹DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

🔹OWASP ZAP

🔹Burp Suite (Community Edition)

🔹Nikto Web Scanner

🔹Kali Linux (optional)

🔹Google Docs / MS Word for the final security report

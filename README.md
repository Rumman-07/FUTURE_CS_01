**🔐 Web Application Security Testing – Internship Project**

This repository showcases my hands-on cybersecurity internship project where I performed a vulnerability assessment on an open-source, intentionally vulnerable web application. The objective was to identify security flaws using ethical hacking tools and align findings with OWASP standards.

This project reflects real-world client scenarios often faced by startups, SaaS platforms, and e-commerce applications that require strong security testing.

**🚀 Project Overview**

Set up and explored test applications like OWASP Juice Shop and DVWA

Performed vulnerability scanning using tools such as:

Burp Suite

OWASP ZAP

Nikto

**Tested for common vulnerabilities:**

SQL Injection (SQLi)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Mapped all findings to the OWASP Top 10

Documented the vulnerabilities with:

Screenshots

Impact assessment

Recommended remediation steps

Compiled a full Security Assessment Report (PDF)

**🧠 Skills Learned**

Web application vulnerability scanning

Basics of ethical hacking & penetration testing

Understanding the OWASP Top 10 risks

Threat modeling & risk analysis

Security documentation and reporting

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
